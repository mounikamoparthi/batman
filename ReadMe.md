# About


This projects shows a fictional portfolio of **Batman**.  There are few design choices explained below on why the decisions are made.


# Font Selection

When ever I think of Batman there is always some **secrecy** and **mystery** involved primarily as Bruce never revels his secret identity so for the reader this page need to give a feel of mystery and suspense so I selected **Palatino** as font as its more retro and old-style serif typeface. 

# Twitter Feed


Small tweeter feeds with out media and default CSS are added. Currently twitter CSS doesn't support custom font type with out loosing the design.


# News


News feed provides a mystery to the readers which explains the opacity of the image and the link on the whole image taking the user to the article page. Also the article titles selected keep the theme intact.


# Office locations

Office locations are standard images centered to the center of block while using the same font style over all.


# Support on multiple devices

The flow will be rendered on multiple screen size devices. I specified setting on small and normal device using **col-xs-12 col-md-4** which will render the blocks stacked on small devices and same row on regular web pages.
